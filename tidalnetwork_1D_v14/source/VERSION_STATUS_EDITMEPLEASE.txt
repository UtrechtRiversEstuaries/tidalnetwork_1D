improved status
27 november 2018
%difference from previous version
only to calculate with different slope and longer upstream channel.
record shields strss for all possible nodal point just in case tides change it

15 January
ustar used calculation from delft3d
store ustar
store theta prime
modified nodal point for bedload+suspended load

17 January
add confluence calculation in initial condition
add option for nodal point calculation. either using total transport to calculate bedslope effect or only bedload

22 january
in case mod(length,dx) is not zero the modification of channel length is automatically calculated

15 april
flow computation is ready for channel networks

16 april
EH predictor has been corrected, adding nodal point for confluence in ini_dia_sedtan_simpang_1

23 april
can simulate phase difference 

3 May 2019
Courant criteria in exner equation is added

9 May 2019
Morfac for original nodal point has been fixed

14 Agustus 2019
Wang Nodal point relationship is added -> simpang_5.m

14 April 2020
- Has been cheked that sedtan_3 is used in which beta for vRijn 1984 formulation is 1 and Phi is neglected
- water level boundary at sea boundary has been fixed so column 1 and 2 is jand j+1 in which in the previous version it was j and j
- water level boundary can apply more than one tidal consituent by adding script Seaboundary_1.m. In this script you can just add the sinusoidal function of each consituent. The ini_dia file that you have to use is ini_dia_2 and Boyo file: Boyo_V4_overtide

2 december 2020
- ini_dia, ini_dia_matrix and Boyo test are to check the widening channel simulations
- the latest version of ini_dia, ini_dia_matrix, Boyo, Sedtan, and Simpang already include multiple tidal components for boundaries, harmonic analysis at the end of simulations, hotstart morphology run, the consistent Shields for sediment transport and nodal point relation, option for constant or changing wetted parameter 


23 April 2021
in_dia_matrix_2 line 239: variable discharge can be used for multiple upstream boundaries, TiMor_1 line 16 Qtot(2) -> Qtot(:,2), simpang_8 line 349 Qy should be Qy_conf.

28 April 2021
suspended sediment and bedload sediment was added for harmonic analysis at the end of simulation in Boyo_V8

29 April 2021
hotstart can be used for multiple bifurcations in ini_dia_matrix_3. Boyo_V8 applied ini_dia_matrix_3

9 December 2022
Human error is fixed in simpang_8 line 435 and ini_dia_sedtan_simpang_1 462 from
Qtot{topoc{conf}(2)}(1,2) = (Qtot{topoc{conf}(3)}(1,2))+(-Qtot{topoc{conf}(1)}(end,2));

Qtot{topoc{conf}(2)}(1,1) = (Qtot{topoc{conf}(3)}(1,1))+(-Qtot{topoc{conf}(1)}(end,1));

to

Qtot{topoc{conf}(2)}(end,2) = (Qtot{topoc{conf}(3)}(1,2))+(-Qtot{topoc{conf}(1)}(end,2));

Qtot{topoc{conf}(2)}(end,1) = (Qtot{topoc{conf}(3)}(1,1))+(-Qtot{topoc{conf}(1)}(end,1));
